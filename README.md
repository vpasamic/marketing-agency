# marketing-agency
This was a task to refactor an existing marketing agency website by Horiseon. Horiseon had originally created the website using only <div> tags. 
As such, it was not optimized for search engines. First, I reorganized the <div> tags into proper semantic html elements such as <header>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer>. I then added alternative texts to the images shown in the website through by assigning the alt attribute to the <img> elements. I originally had trouble with adding alternative text to the main cover photo. As such, instead of leaving it as a <div> element. I just inserted it as another image. But, if I had left it as is, it would stretch and squish depending on the size of the browser. This was unpleasant to look at. As such, I made the image to fit its container through maintaing its  aspect ration. This leaves the desired effect similar to leaving it as a <div> element background image. I also added a hidden <h1> element to better optimize the website for search engines.
